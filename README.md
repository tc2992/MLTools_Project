The estimation and analyzation of heterogeneous treatment effect in experimental and observa-tional studies has been a popular topic in recent years. K ̈unzel et al (2017) introduced the X-learner,a metalearner to estimate conditional average treatment effect (CATE), and showed that it per-formed well overall, especially in the real and imbalance datasets.  Our project aims to reproducethe main experiment on social pressure and voter turnout described in the paper, and to examinethe performance of X-learner in comparison with the S-learner and T-learner.  Our second goal isto expand beyond the paper by replacing the base learner with some more commonly used machinelearning models, such as random forest (instead of honest random forest), logistic regression, andmultilayer perceptron.  We aim to report how the performance of the three metalearners changeand whether we could achieve better results with different base learners.
